Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
This project implements Time Series Analysis and Forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict future trends based on historical data. The goal is to provide insights and forecasts, which can be useful for business decisions such as sales, stock prices, or demand forecasting.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For statistical plots and visualizations.
statsmodels: For ARIMA modeling and statistical tests.
numpy: For numerical operations.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the time series data for analysis.
Stationarity Check: Use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check if the data is stationary.
ARIMA Modeling: Apply ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
Forecasting: Generate future predictions based on historical data.
Visualization: Visualize both actual and forecasted data.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dakshitha18/time-series-forecasting.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd time-series-forecasting
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:

bash
Copy code

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a time series dataset. You can replace the dataset path in the code with your own CSV file containing the time series data.

Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of errors.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE.
Future Work
Experiment with other time series models like SARIMA, Prophet, etc.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for better forecasting accuracy.
Implement the model for real-time forecasting using streaming data.
